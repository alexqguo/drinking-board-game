Problematic spots:
  - Zubat: Zubats... they're...they're everywhere! Take a drink. Next turn, if you roll a 1 or 2, stay here and take a drink!
  - SS ANNE (todo)
    - maybe make a DrinkDuringLostTurnsRule?
  - Lapras: Lapras used Confuse Ray! Pick a player, they are now confused. Next turn, they must roll a 1-3 to stop being confused. If not, they are still confused and lose a turn.
    - maybe just make this a display rule?
  - Hitmonlee/chan: Challenge someone to a chugging contest. First to finish gets an extra turn, last to finish loses a turn
  - Cinnabar Gym (todo)
  - Legendary birds

boardgame.io has some examples

- is it necessary to call out display rule if it's a noop? good to have there for now maybe
- maybe add a DiceRollRule

*OVERALL PLAN*

phase 0:
- game is playable offline with multiple people at the same computer
- no image scaling

phase 1:
- keep game state in localstorage in case someone closes the screen
- skip button

phase 2: 
- game is playable via websockets OR offline
- for websockets, keep game state in memory on host as it will only be played
- can designate drinks on screen and keep track of the counts throughout the game

phase 3:
- can add/remove players mid game
