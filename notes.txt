Structure for board:
Board
  String img
  Tile[] tiles

Tile
  String displayText
  Boolean isMandatory
  Rule rule
  ??? coordinates

Abstract Rule
  RuleType type // rule type, should be enum
  Boolean conditional
  String playerTarget // self, all, allOther, custom
  Object diceRollsRequired // optional, if the rule requires a dice roll to determine something
  {
    diceRollsRequired: true,
    numRollsRequired: 1,
    "1,2,3": SkipTurnRule,
    "4,5,6": DisplayRule
  }

DisplayRule
  // no-op. for things like giving/taking drinks

SpeedModifierRule
  // to go faster/slower
  Number multiplier
  Number numTurns

SkipTurnRule
  Integer numTurns // number of turns you will lose

ExtraTurnRule
  Integer numTurns // number of extra turns to take

TeleportRule
  Number tileIndex // index of the tile to teleport to

MoveRule
  String direction
  Number numSpaces

rules still needed:
RollUntilRule ?? maybe there should be a generic DiceRollRule with options for number of rolls
  - numRollsRequired: number, can also be "until" something
ChoiceRule ("Your pokemon is evolving")
OffscreenOutcomeRule ("Challenge someone to a chugging contest")
DiceRollRule (done in Phase 1), will replace the "diceRolls" attribute

also have to implement zones- used in pokemon and zelda games

Problematic spots:
  - Zubat: Zubats... they're...they're everywhere! Take a drink. Next turn, if you roll a 1 or 2, stay here and take a drink!
  - SS ANNE (todo)
    - maybe make a DrinkDuringLostTurnsRule?
  - Lapras: Lapras used Confuse Ray! Pick a player, they are now confused. Next turn, they must roll a 1-3 to stop being confused. If not, they are still confused and lose a turn.
    - maybe just make this a display rule?
  - Hitmonlee/chan: Challenge someone to a chugging contest. First to finish gets an extra turn, last to finish loses a turn
  - Cinnabar Gym (todo)
  - Legendary birds
  - Missingno

*OVERALL PLAN*

phase 0:
- game is playable offline with multiple people at the same computer
- zones
- no image scaling
  - image will be displayed via the background css property at full size
  - window will scroll automatically turn to turn
- skip button (required for Gary as you don't move on until you're done with your drink)
- asset minification

phase 1:
- track game state, store in localstorage in case someone closes the screen
- queue of who rolled what in the corner
- DiceRollRule with prompts for rules that require you to roll a die, though not necessarily take actions from it

phase 2: 
- game is playable via websockets OR offline
- for websockets, keep game state in memory on host as it will only be played

phase 3:
- keep track of the drink counts throughout the game
- alert players when they are supposed to drink
- can designate drinks on screen
- trainer battles

phase 4:
- can add/remove players mid game
