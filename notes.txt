Structure for board:
Board
  String img
  Tile[] tiles

Tile
  String displayText
  Boolean isMandatory
  Rule rule
  ??? coordinates

Abstract Rule
  RuleType type // rule type, should be enum
  Boolean conditional
  String playerTarget // self, all, allOther, custom
  Object diceRollsRequired // optional, if the rule requires a dice roll to determine something
  {
    diceRollsRequired: true,
    numRollsRequired: 1,
    "1,2,3": SkipTurnRule,
    "4,5,6": DisplayRule
  }

DisplayRule
  // no-op. for things like giving/taking drinks

SpeedModifierRule
  // to go faster/slower
  Number multiplier
  Number numTurns

SkipTurnRule
  Integer numTurns // number of turns you will lose

ExtraTurnRule
  Integer numTurns // number of extra turns to take

TeleportRule
  Number tileIndex // index of the tile to teleport to

MoveRule
  String direction
  Number numSpaces

rules still needed:
RollUntilRule ?? maybe there should be a generic DiceRollRule with options for number of rolls
  - numRollsRequired: number, can also be "until" something
ChoiceRule ("Your pokemon is evolving")
OffscreenOutcomeRule ("Challenge someone to a chugging contest")
DiceRollRule (done in M1), will replace the "diceRolls" attribute

also have to implement zones- used in pokemon and zelda games

create a UI class/util to deal with the modal and popping up windows or something. the initial loading screen in App.ts should use this too
this should be the only place we do serious rendering to the page

Problematic spots:
  - Zubat: Zubats... they're...they're everywhere! Take a drink. Next turn, if you roll a 1 or 2, stay here and take a drink!
  - SS ANNE (todo)
    - maybe make a DrinkDuringLostTurnsRule?
  - Lapras: Lapras used Confuse Ray! Pick a player, they are now confused. Next turn, they must roll a 1-3 to stop being confused. If not, they are still confused and lose a turn.
    - maybe just make this a display rule?
  - Hitmonlee/chan: Challenge someone to a chugging contest. First to finish gets an extra turn, last to finish loses a turn
  - Cinnabar Gym (todo. RollUntil?)
  - Pokemon is evolving. Choice rule, evolve is a free pass (can live on player, stop is an extra turn rule)
  - Legendary birds (the tile keeps a state per player or something?)
  - Missingno: see above note for RollUntilRule. it would be a dice roll rule with a max three

---

Effects:

Player
  - effects: list of lists
  [ // list of upcoming turns
    [], // list of effects for a particular turn
    []
  ]

What can be an effect? how will this work? effects fire before the turn
  - speed modifier rule will be an effect
  - skip turn rule will be an effect (done)
  - zubat rule will be an effect
  - zones would be an effect
