Problematic spots:
  - Zubat: Zubats... they're...they're everywhere! Take a drink. Next turn, if you roll a 1 or 2, stay here and take a drink!
  - SS ANNE (todo)
    - maybe make a DrinkDuringLostTurnsRule?
  - Lapras: Lapras used Confuse Ray! Pick a player, they are now confused. Next turn, they must roll a 1-3 to stop being confused. If not, they are still confused and lose a turn.
    - maybe just make this a display rule?
  - Hitmonlee/chan: Challenge someone to a chugging contest. First to finish gets an extra turn, last to finish loses a turn
  - Cinnabar Gym (todo)
  - Legendary birds

- (will need a skip button, for Gary or if someone is AFK)
- is it necessary to call out display rule if it's a noop? good to have there for now maybe
- maybe add a DiceRollRule
